# auth-react
Just a demo project in which I built a server using nodejs, [express](https://expressjs.com) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with the functionality of signing up and logging in users, and connected that with a react application.

## Installation
Fork the project and run `npm install` in both the directories. Then - 
1) Start a local mongoDB database on **`127.0.0.1`** at PORT **27017**.
2) Run `npm start` in the server directory to start the server at port 8000.
3) Run `npm start` in the client directory to start the web app at port 3000.
